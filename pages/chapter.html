                    <h2>A Brief History</h2>
                    <p>
                        BASH-TSA was founded in 1989. Currently, Joshua Pennington is the advisor. 
The chapter has cultivated its image by hosting events, fundraisers, and performing well in all competitions.
The chapter has also had many members place as finalists in the regional, state, and national competitions in past years.
The Boyertown chapter is heavily involved with TSA and making a contribution to the club as well as the community through its events and achievements. 
</br>
BASH-TSA has had 3 state presidents. Mark Schell held the presidency from 1993-94, and Olivia Crocker held the presidency from 2015-16. 
Currently, Abigail Reigner from Boyertown holds the office of state President and Joshua Famous from Boyertown holds the office of Sergeant-at-Arms.

                    <h2>What We Do</h2>
                    <p>
                        BASH-TSA is recognized for hosting many events and for its strong image throughout TSA. The chapter’s annual spaghetti dinner, is known throughout the school and is one of the more successful fundraisers hosted throughout the year. Others include clothing drives, T-Shirt sales, and bingo night.
		<br>
It is also important for BASH-TSA to remain involved with the school and the community. The chapter does this by participating in events such as the Homecoming Carnival and pep rally.  It also helps outside of the school by often working closely together with the local multiservice, Salvation Army, and Goodwill. 
		<br>
A large part of BASH-TSA’s involvement includes fundraising for the ACS. Over $6,000 in the past three years have been donated by the chapter from their fundraising, and it has been recognized by the State Inspiration Award in 2017 and the Purple Award from 2016-18.

I will explore on my own for safer, more effective methods of working and living. I will strive to develop a cooperative attitude and will exercise tact and respect for other individuals. Through the work of my hands and mind, I will express my ideas to the best of my ability. I will make it my goal to do better each day the task before me, and to be steadfast in my belief in my God, and my fellow Americans.</p>
