                  <p>
                      This past December, the chapter members hosted its first Adopt-A-Child. The chapter was given a list of less fortunate children from the community and what they wanted for Christmas. The students then all brought in money to buy those items for the children. Each grade was split up and made it into a friendly competition to see who could get the most gifts for as many children as possible. This helped to add energy to the event, while motivating everyone to participate more and giving the most that they could to the children “adopted.” Overall, hundreds of dollars were made from this event just from inside of the chapter. After trying it for the first time this year, Adopt-A-Child was a huge success and the members look forward to doing it for years to come. Not only did it put everyone in the holiday spirit, but it made Christmas better for some children.

                  <p>
                      On December 12, BASH-TSA hosted their annual spaghetti dinner. This dinner is open to friends, families, teachers, and community members alike. The dinner consists of spaghetti, alad, buttered rolls, drinks, and most importantly, all-you-can-eat dessert, all prepared by chapter members.

                  <p>
                     Students benefit not only from the experience, but all funds from tickets sold by individual students go directly to them to fund the state trip. Tickets can also be bought at the door, but it is a great opportunity for students to alleviate the cost of going to States. Like other years, the dinner was a huge success. Guests enjoyed the food and the ability to help students out in pursuing their love of technology and of TSA.

                  <p>
                     In the Spring of 2017, BASH TSA hosted their second annual bag bingo night at the NORCO Fire Company. Tickets were sold ahead of time and were gone within weeks following the success of the previous years’ bag bingo. Students help at the event by setting up, serving food, helping to run the event, and cleaning up. The profits were split between all students who volunteered to help fund their trip to the state conference.   
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Other items were donated by local vendors, who were able to sell their products during the bingo, giving guests more things to do and a better experience. There was also a 50/50 raffle hosted which generated a lot of participation. Overall, the chapter made a total of $4,200. The popularity of this event year after year shows the support of the community to help further students’ educational career and opportunities, as well as the pride in success of the chapter.

                  <h2>Painting With a Twist</h2>
                  <p>
                     BASH TSA hosted a social event at Painting With a Twist in November 2018. Members had a good time enjoying snacks and expressing their creativity. They painted snowmen with individual touches and got the opportunity to try and paint each other. This was a good experience for students to work together outside of the typical classroom, as well as socialize outside of normal groups and meet new people in the chapter. The event was successful in ensuring unity and happiness with each chapter member.

                  <p>
                      This past October, BASH-TSA sold Pink-Out T-Shirts during Homecoming week to boost school spirit and donate to a good cause. The shirts were sold during lunch for $10 the entire week leading up to the Homecoming pep rally. A total of $4,712 was made and all of the proceeds were donated to the American Cancer Society. On Friday during the pep rally, the gym was a sea of pink shirts full of excitement and school spirit. This event was a huge success in not only uniting the school, but raising money for a good cause.

                  <p>
                      BASH-TSA ran their third clothing drive in a row, collecting donated clothes, stuffed animals, and blankets from the school and from the community. Twelve hundred pounds of clothing were collected in total, amounting to more than $2,000 worth of items. It also achieved a huge number of participators, including students, families, and community members. Two trucks were filled with bags of clothing and then donated to those in need. This drive is a great way to get people involved in a good cause and to show what our club is capable of with teamwork and dedication.
