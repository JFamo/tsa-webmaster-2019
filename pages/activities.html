                  <h2>Homecoming Carnival</h2>
                  <p>
                      Each year during the school’s Homecoming Carnival, the Boyertown Area Senior High School TSA runs a stand selling food, fun, and opportunities to win prizes. For the price of a few tickets, carnival-goers can eat hot dogs or walking tacos, or even enjoy a cold water or soda. The stand consisted of TSA members volunteering time after school and into the evening to make food, handle tickets, and enjoy the festivities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      In the week leading up to the Homecoming game, the entire school participated in Spirit Week, and the BASH-TSA Chapter was not afraid to sport their school pride! Members participated in America Monday, Tacky Tourist Day, Holiday Wednesday, College Day, and Spirit Day, and worked tirelessly to develop fun games and prizes for the yearly carnival.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      TSA’s representation at the carnival cemented its image to students, staff, and the community that it is more than just a technology club. While winning awards at the regional, state, and national levels can turn local heads, simply showing the community compassion by offering a cold drink also makes a powerful statement. Wherever there is a chance to lift spirits and stir up some fun in the local area, BASH-TSA is always there!

                  <h2>Spaghetti Dinner</h2>
                  <p>
                      In early December, BASH-TSA hosts a yearly spaghetti buffet to friends and families of TSA members, as well as teachers, people of the community, and even school board members. The all-you-can-eat dinner includes mouth-watering spaghetti, a side salad, fluffy buttered rolls, a variety of drinks, and a delicious assortment of homemade desserts. At $10 a meal, including to-go boxes, it is always a bargain and a popular fundraiser for the community and TSA members.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      TSA students are encouraged to sell as many tickets as they can in the weeks leading up to the event, though tickets can also be bought at the door. Profits from pre-sold tickets go directly to individuals to finance their trip to the state conference in April. By offering this fundraising opportunity, BASH-TSA allows students to more effectively find necessary funds. With a love of technology comes a love of giving the best opportunities to students who pursue it, and because of this, the BASH-TSA Spaghetti Dinner is always a huge success.

                  <h2>Bag Bingo</h2>
                  <p>
                      At the suggestion of the 2016-17 fundraising committee, BASH-TSA developed a bag bingo night for addition fundraising for the state conference. By selling tickets ahead of time and online, the event was sold out within a few weeks. On the day of, students joined together to make and serve food through donations, help run the event itself, and clean up afterwards. It included a 50/50 ticket raffle, and many vendors brought their wares to the bingo night, creating a busy, successful atmosphere that lasted the entire evening. The profits of $4,200.00 went to each student who volunteered their time to run the event to fund the students’ PA TSA State conference trip. As well as this, the chapter was able to work alongside the NORCO Fire Department, its first involvement with a local community organization. The chapter looks forward to running the event in years to come.

                      BASH-TSA strives to enable students to pursue their love of technology and refuses to let any financial difficulties get in the way of that passion. A commitment to the finding and founding of fundraising opportunities defines and elevates success at BASH-TSA, and the bingo night characterizes that commitment.

                  <h2>Painting With a Twist</h2>
                  <p>
                      To drum up some hype within the club, a Painting With A Twist party was organized near the beginning of the year. Members enjoyed an evening of creative expression, snacks, and fellowship, including participating in social media and painting competitions. Getting together to paint reinforced friendship as not only a chapter, but as a team. Students became closer with old pals and made new connections while laughing and socializing outside of the technology education rooms. An important part of success as a TSA chapter is the unity between members, and BASH-TSA always makes sure of this.

                  <p>
                      To raise money for the American Cancer Society, BASH-TSA sold t-shirts in the week leading up to a school pep rally. Every day at lunch, during every period, BASH-TSA members setup shop at a table in the lunch room and vended shirts to fellow students. The shirts encouraged a blue-out for Men's Prostate Cancer awareness. Many shirts were sold, and the chapter anticipates being able to make a sizeable donation at the end of the year. The two year total for the event raised $8,853. BASH-TSA was able to not only make a large donation to men's prostate cancer research, but also banded together with BASH Student Council to raise awareness for their yearly MiniThon event. ~~~It might be nice to include a link to FTK here or something

                  <p>
                      For the past three years, BASH-TSA has run a successful school-wide clothing drive. The event collected twelve hundred pounds of clothing in the 2015-16 year. In fact, advisors and student leaders expected only one truck load of clothing, but the entire chapter was ecstatic when a second trip to Virginia and back was necessary! In total, BASH-TSA has collected more than $2000 worth, which is thousands of pounds of clothes. This fundraiser prompts students, teachers, and families to clean out their closets and get organized for a cause. BASH-TSA frequently exhibits its commitment to finding new and innovative ways to raise money for charity and maximize chapter, school, and community participation.
